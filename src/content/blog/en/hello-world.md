This is the first post on my new site. I built it with Astro, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript — a stack that prioritizes speed, simplicity, and developer experience.

## Why a personal site?

Every engineer should have a corner of the internet they control. Social platforms come and go, algorithms change, but your own domain is yours.

## What to expect

I'll write about engineering, tools I use, patterns I find interesting, and the occasional opinion about how we build software. Posts will appear in both English and Portuguese.

## The stack

- **Astro** for static site generation with content collections
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling with design tokens
- **TypeScript** throughout
- **Cloudflare Pages** for hosting

More soon.
